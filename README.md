# CaffeinatedOpe's Awesome list
## a list of stuff i think is awesome
like publicized bookmarks i guess

## Lighting:
* [WLED](https://kno.wled.ge)
	* A firmware for esp32 devices to control addressable leds, which happens to be absolutely awesome. I've used it for quite a few projects (might share eventually), and haven't had many complaints.
* [xLights](https://xlights.org/)
	* Awesome for making pre-programmed mapped lightshows. A bit finnicky, limited effects, looks pretty old fashoned, but it integrates well with WLED, and makes it easy to make some cool animations.
* [LedFx](https://github.com/LedFx/LedFx)
	* a bit janky sometimes, but works pretty well for just throwing on music and lights.

## Audio
* [Finamp](https://github.com/jmshrv/finamp)
	* Best ios app I've found for streaming media from Jellyfin, with downloads.
* [decent samples](https://www.decentsamples.com/)
	* A mix of paid and free audio plugins, with an open source engine, and works on linux!

## Other
### not quite software? but not just a github, either
* [Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com/)
